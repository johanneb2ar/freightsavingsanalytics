# Allina Health Freight Savings Analytics
This repository hosts the 'Allina Health Freight Savings Analytics' project, a multi-faceted analytical framework designed to streamline and optimize freight costs. The project showcases a complete lifecycle from raw data analysis to actionable cost-saving measures, all tailored for Allina Health, featuring a blend of data preprocessing, a robust recommendation system, and effective freight cost reduction strategies.

This project is structured into three main components, each critical to our overall objective of optimizing freight cost savings. We advise all users to navigate through the directories in the sequential order of 1-2-3 for a comprehensive understanding.

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Analysis

This section is divided into two key areas:

- **Clean Datasets from Us**: This folder contains datasets that our team has meticulously cleaned and prepared for analysis.
- **Original Datasets from Allina Health**: Here, you will find the raw datasets as provided by Allina Health.

The core of this section is the `Data Analysis Code` (available in both IPython Notebook and HTML formats). It details our process of data cleaning, analysis, and the subsequent visualizations that we derived from this data.

## 2. Recommendation System

The second phase of our project involves the development of a recommendation system. This folder is organized into:

- **Recommendation Model Building**: It encompasses the methodologies and algorithms we used to build the recommendation model.
- **Flask App Design**: This sub-folder explains how we designed and implemented a Flask application to deploy our recommendation model effectively.

This section is vital for understanding the mechanics behind our recommendation system and its practical implementation.

## 3. Freight Cost Reduction

In the final part of our project:

- You will encounter our approach to applying the recommendation model for freight cost reduction specifically for Allina Health.
- This folder includes detailed documentation and datasets pertaining to various scenarios and the corresponding output results, showcasing the effectiveness of our model in real-world applications.

Each component of this project plays a pivotal role in achieving our goal of freight cost savings for Allina Health. We encourage a thorough review of each section to grasp the full scope of our analytics endeavor.
